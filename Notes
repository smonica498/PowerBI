1. Data Discovery / Data Cleansing phase : Get Data, Transform Data (Ribbon)1. Data Discovery / Data Cleansing phase : Get Data, Transform Data (Ribbon)
2. Data Modeling / Data Mashup : Data View, Model View (LHS - Last 2)
3. Data Visualization : Report view (LHS - top)
4. Data Sharing : Publish (Ribbon - RHS) (Subscription, Power BI Service, Licensing)

LHS -> Views
RHS -> Panes
Top -> Ribbon / Tabs

Get Data -> Web -> URL -> 

Access Web Content window opens up : 
how going to authenticate to that source 

then : data preview
Load -  take data see above and then load into power bi data model and immediately can start making viz
Transform data / Edit - when need to fix data. Going to launch / open Power Query for Data cleansing / transform

1. Transform Data: opens another window of Power Query editor
pbix - file extension
Rename Query - more appropriate and user friendly name for data model table : 
Query Setting pane : rename the Query name (if accidently hit x then Click on View -> Query Settings), Applied Steps (Little Gear icon to edit that step x to cancel the step)
Diffrent Data Types of the column - can get different types of transform available

Remove columns that is not needed - 
Method 1 Right click -> Remove Columns
Method 2 Home Tab -> Choose Columns -> Choose Colums to keep   
Transform date to Year - Right click -> Duplicate. On Duplicated column, Right click -> Transform ->Year -> Year 
Combine 2 colums/fields together - 1 city name in multiple States so less ambiguous
Method 1 Select 2 columns, Right click -> Merge columns
Method 2 Add column Tab -> Column Form Examples -> From All Columns (can give example and Power BI can find patterns)

when done with Transform step :
Home Tab -> Close and Apply

2. Data Modeling:
Benefits of having separate date table - Fiscal year start and end different for different orgs
For retail, how sale is doing on weends vs weekdays or holidays
Add Date Table :
Method 1 Pull from data source
Method 2 Power Query Script
Method 3 DAX (Data Analysis Expression Language)

DAX (1. DAX Calculated columns 2. DAX Calculated measures (below is 1) ): LHS -> Data View (middle one)
Table Tools tab -> On Ribbon, New Table 
Calendar = CALENDARAUTO()
Table Tools -> New Columns 
Year = YEAR('Calendar'[Date])
Month Number = MONTH('Calendar'[Date])
Month = FORMAT([Date],"mmmm") 
mmmm January
mmm Jan
mmm-yyyy Jan-2000
dddd Saturday
dd 01 (Day of Month)

Model View:
Relationship 
Table drag and drop to connect


Modeling Tab:
Measures vs Columns
- Metrics      - Descriptive
- Aggregates   - Categorical
Method 1 Modeling -> Measure
Method 2 Right click on Table -> Measure
Total Banks = Count
3. Data Visualizatons:
Select Viz 
Axis
Legend
Values 
Issue 1: Graph same values in graph because there is no relationship between 2 tables - to solve Model view
Issue 2: Sort by Months chronologically (In viz, ... -> Sort by -> Month still not exactly fixed)
Click on the Nmae of the column i.e. Month on Fields pane -> Column Tools Ribbon -> Sort by Column -> Month Number

Select a chart -> Format Tab -> Edit interactions -> Filter, Highlight, None

View Tab -> Themes -> Customize -> Save JSON File -> Browse theme

For Tooltip:
New Page
Format -
Page Information -> Tooltio ON
Page Size -> Type: Tooltip
Page background -> Colar, Transparency
Viz:
Card - Fields: Total Banks
Map - Location: City ST, Size: Total Banks
Still no data points on Map why? 
Select Map -> Click on City ST -> Colum Tools Tab -> Data Category: Place
Now go to Fields (beside Format) -> Tooltip -> Drag and drop State

Double click on the page or  Viz Q&A
eg. Total banks by State between 2015 and 2020 as treemap

4. Data Sharing: Cloud oart of Power BI
Publish -> Sign in to account -> Save work on local work station -> pbix file -> Select a destination (work space)

Share, Refresh
